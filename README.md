# Wind Speeds Prediction with Convolutional Neural Networks

**Type:** Project and Solution developed for the [Predict Wind Speeds of Tropical Storms](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/72/predict-wind-speeds/) competition from DrivenData.org

**Group:** Francisco Costa, Jo√£o Gouveia, Pedro Rivera

**Programming Languages and Technologies:** Python, Tensorflow

**Objective:** Under the concept of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this project aims to aims to build a NN capable of predict wind speeds of Tropical Storms from satellite images.
